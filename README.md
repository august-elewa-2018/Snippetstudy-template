<!---
- Identify a concept or skill you sort of understand, but would like to master. gradually develop the clearest snippet to communicate this principle
- Construct (or find) a simple example that isolates this skill or concept.
- Software tools to visualize code behavior
- Break down the snippet:
  - Is there anything you're not familiar with that isn't your target concept?
  - Do the variables names help understand the code?
  - Are there any logs or asserts that might help?
  - Avoid Comments, let the code's behavior speak for itself.
  - Does it fit well with the chosen study environment?
- Use paper & pencil to sketch code behavior
- Describe & predict code behavior
- Understand the same code from different perspectives
- Select the right visualization tools for your use case

S1. _to be continued_
   
Tracing table (deconstruction of input/output):
   
State nr. | State | Operation
------------|------------ | -------------
S0  | null |
